            Hi! I'm <strong>Kyle Sepulveda</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented developer with a focus on
            building modern web applications. I enjoy solving complex problems and constantly learning
            new technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey started with a curiosity for how things work on the web, and over time, Iâ€™ve worked
            on various projects using React, JavaScript, and backend tools like Node.js and MySQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I love  photography, gaming, reading, or traveling.
            I believe in continuous growth and strive to improve both professionally and personally.
          </p>
